## 🛡️ Tips for Safer Use

Smart usage habits are just as important as good obfuscation:

- **Use an alternate account** — never execute a new script version on your main account first
- **Don't flash wealth publicly** — jumping from zero to maxed gear in seconds in a public server draws attention; use private sessions for the most aggressive farming
- **Keep the script updated** — always pull the latest build from the **south bronx the trenches script github** repo; outdated scripts are the top detection risk
- **Enable spoofing before farming** — always ensure the spoofing module is active before running the money farm in populated servers
- **Avoid streaming with the GUI visible** — this creates evidence and violates Roblox ToS
- **Use the dupe script in private servers** — the **south bronx the trenches dupe script** is safest when no other players can observe sudden inventory changes
- **Follow ban wave alerts** — the **south bronx the trenches script discord** server posts real-time warnings whenever Roblox deploys new anti-cheat measures
